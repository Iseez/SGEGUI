# SGEGUI
A GUI meant to send batch jobs via sge through ssh.
This is in a very early stage of development and its main purpose is to learn how to develop a GUI, stablish an ssh communication and communicate via ssh.
Its secondary purpose is to make it easier for people with very little to no computational background to make use of a cluster with Sun Grid Engine to send jobs, mainly so they dont have to use the terminal.
Its primarly targeted to biologists transitioning to a more bioinformatical profile or that occasionaly need to make bioinformatic analysis. But it may be useful to other people.
Ideas and advice are welomed.
